# AOC2023
Advent of code 2023 in Rust

## Structure of the code
- Parsing always happens in the beginning of the `main`` function
- running the main function with `cargo run` will run the code for the current day
- `cargo run` always displays : 
    - `first_star : "answer of the day 1st star"`
    - `second star : "answer of the day 2nd star"`
